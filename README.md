Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The Tickethack project consisted in creating a train ticket booking website with a frontend and a backend. I developed a home page to search for trips, a shopping cart page to display and manage selected trips, and a bookings page to view paid trips. I used Express Generator for the backend, made fetch requests for the communication between the frontend and the backend, and respected the clean code principles.
